- Hi Corona, if you read this you have a little bug in mobile version.
  so I hope you like my humble version.

- For the SCSS branch in VSCode you need to install `live sass compiler`
  After hit the button `watch sass`

## Branches

- Normal CSS `git switch cssonly`
- Maybe complicated but fair enough `git switch bootstrapScss`
